# AutoFocus Todo List App Experiment

Goal: One or more creators make a **todo list app** that follows the todo list steps defined here: [Mark Forster AutoFocus Time Management System](http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/) for command line and responsive web. The project will use micro-tasking methods described by [Yegor256](https://www.youtube.com/user/technoparkcorp/) in his conference talk ([eXtremely Distributed Software Development, at DevTernity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EytYc7K5JA)) to keep motivation and focus high.
