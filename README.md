## Intent, Method, Team, Motivation

### What:
To make a concise todo list app that follows the todo list algorithm defined here: [Mark Forster AutoFocus Time Management System](http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/)
1. for console command line, and
2. for responsive web

### How:
- Project architecture & micro-tasking methodologies as described by [Yegor256](https://www.youtube.com/user/technoparkcorp/) in his conference talk here: [eXtremely Distributed Software Development, at DevTernity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EytYc7K5JA)
- Source control: GitHub
- Tech stack: TypeScript Back-end, (TBD) Front-end

### Who:
Solo developer, architect, designer, tester, researcher: Yours truly

### Why:
To test the viability of the methodologies of software management, architecture, & design, as espoused by creator, entrepreneur, & speaker Yegor256.

### When:
Go as far as possible, ~~devoting at least 1 hour per day, every day (for a minimum of 7 hours per week) for 1 month~~, for 2 months starting yesterday: Tuesday, December 24th, 2019.

### Creator's notes:
It is my intention to further analyze if/when issues seem consistently stuck/blocked/delayed both:
1. how SMART (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, for which I am Responsible, and Time-bound) the issue is, and
2. how Motivated (M=EV/ID where motivation equals expectancy times value divided by impulsiveness times delay) the dev/designer/architect is in relation to the issue
