# AutoFocus Todo List App Experiment

Goal: One or more creators make a **todo list app** that follows the todo list algorithm defined here: [Mark Forster AutoFocus Time Management System](http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/) for console command line and responsive web. They will use micro-tasking methodologies as described by [Yegor256](https://www.youtube.com/user/technoparkcorp/) in his conference talk here: [eXtremely Distributed Software Development, at DevTernity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EytYc7K5JA)

## FAQ
Q: What will this app look like? A: [See the Figma design doc](https://www.figma.com/file/xLQLwhw01n12pKgAnRt8Pt/AutoFocus-Design-Doc?node-id=0%3A1)

Q: What does CLA stand for? A: [See the glossary](https://github.com/avidrucker/autofocus-exp/blob/master/docs/glossary.md)

Q: What is the AutoFocus algorithm? A: [See the FVP algorithm summary](https://github.com/avidrucker/autofocus-exp/blob/master/docs/algorithm.md)

Q: What are the general user stories for the app? A: [See the "Quick Start" User Stories](https://github.com/avidrucker/autofocus-exp/blob/master/quick_start_user_stories.md)

Q: Is there a full example of the algorithm used in the wild? A: [Yes: See an "E2E Test" of FVP](https://github.com/avidrucker/autofocus-exp/blob/master/end-to-end-test-fvp.md)

Q: What are the unique data structures / shapes used in this app? A:

- [Todo Item Shape](https://github.com/avidrucker/autofocus-exp/blob/master/todo_item_shape.md)
- [Current State Enum](https://github.com/avidrucker/autofocus-exp/blob/master/current_state_enum.md)

## Installation

1. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build the project: `npm run-script build`
3. Test the project: `npm test`
4. Run the app: `npm run-script run`

> - You can also build project & run the CLA: `npm run-script build-and-run`
> - Or, build project & test the CLA: `npm run-script build-and-test`

## Intent, Method, Team, Motivation

### How:
- Source control: GitHub repository
- Project management: GitHub issues
- Tech stack: TypeScript Back-end, (TBD) Front-end

### Roles:
Developer, architect, designer, tester, researcher, project maintainer

### Why:
To test the viability of the methodologies of software management, architecture, & design, as espoused by creator, entrepreneur, & speaker Yegor256.

### When:
Go as far as possible, ~~devoting at least 1 hour per day, every day (for a minimum of 7 hours per week) for 1 month~~, for 2 months starting yesterday: Tuesday, December 24th, 2019.

### Creator's notes:
It is my intention to further analyze if/when issues seem consistently stuck/blocked/delayed both:
1. how SMART (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, for which I am Responsible, and Time-bound) the issue is, and
2. how Motivated (M=EV/ID where motivation equals expectancy times value divided by impulsiveness times delay) the dev/designer/architect is in relation to the issue
