# AutoFocus Todo List App Experiment

**Goal**: One or more creators make a **todo list app** that follows the todo list steps defined here: [Mark Forster AutoFocus Time Management System](http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/) for command line and responsive web. The project contributors will use only GitHub issues to communicate with each other, keeping the repository as the project's SSoT<sup>[1] [2]</sup>.
