# AutoFocus Writer's Guide

## We're looking for writers / editors

Welcome fellow writer/editor! We could use your help in making the writing on this project as easy to read as possible. Basically, anything that you can read in this entire project is open to be rewritten, unless marked otherwise.

In order to contribute and be compensated for your time and efforts, please make sure to confirm that the work you do was either already advertised as an [open writing task](https://github.com/avidrucker/autofocus-exp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awriting), or, you suggested and received a direct "Yes, please do that" from the project owner, @avidrucker
