## How to Contribute

Please know that this project's goal is keep communication strictly to GitHub issues and comments.

**Developers**:

- Install & run the app: [Install Instructions](https://github.com/avidrucker/autofocus-exp/blob/master/docs/how-to-install.md)
- Pick an issue, create a new branch with the naming convention: `issue-052-short-title` (yours could be `issue-173-fix-spelling-mistakes`, for example)
- Commit often, with conventional commits
- Once your code runs without any linting errors & you have written appropriate unit tests for the code you have written, push to a remote branch with the same name as your local branch (eg. "`issue-052-short-title`")
