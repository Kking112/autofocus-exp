# Compensation Guidelines

For this project, I'd like to compensate you for your contributions. That said, I won't compensate people for just anything. There are some rules ;)

To know/ask more about payment processes, see [this issue which explains payment methods](https://github.com/avidrucker/autofocus-exp/issues/173).

## General Rules
You can only get compensated for work that:

1. Has been approved by me
2. Has been scoped with a time amount
3. Is in the current mile-stone (as of now it is `mvp-demo`)
4. Doesn't appear to be hastily or sloppily done. Quality counts.

## Code Submission Rules
Submitted code:

1. has the relevant unit tests added for new code
2. it passes all linting checks
3. it pass the entire project's suite of tests

The above three points mean your work is good enough to merge with the project's codebase.

## Design Submission Rules
Design deliverables have been:  

1. delivered & saved to the master Figma document  
2. confirmed by me to provide an acceptable design deliverable (with further revisions a possibility)  

## Suggestion Submission Rules
Each suggestion has been:  

1. confirmed as understood by me  
2. confirmed as as original, non-duplicate ideas to the project  

Please feel free to open a new question thread if you have any further compensation rule questions.
