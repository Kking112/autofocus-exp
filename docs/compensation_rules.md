# Compensation Guidelines

For this project, I'd like to compensate you for your contributions. That said, I won't compensate people for just anything. There are some rules ;)

To know/ask more about payment processes, see [this issue which explains payment methods](https://github.com/avidrucker/autofocus-exp/issues/173).

## General Rules
You can only get compensated for work that:

1. Has been approved by the project manager @avidrucker
2. Has been "scoped" (labeled) with a time amount
3. Is in the current mile-stone (it is currently "`mvp-demo`")
4. Doesn't appear to be hastily or sloppily done. Quality counts.

## Code Submission Guidelines
Submitted code:

1. has the relevant unit tests added for new code
2. passes all linting checks
3. passes the entire project's test suite

The above three points mean your work is good enough to merge with the project's codebase.

## Design Submission Guidelines
Design deliverables have been:  

1. delivered & saved to the master Figma document  
2. confirmed by me to provide an acceptable design deliverable (with further revisions a possibility)  

## Writing Submission Guidelines

Writing deliverables have been:  

1. delivered as an issue comment, pull request, or via another mutually accepted document delivery method (Google Docs, email, etc.)
2. confirmed by me as acceptable quality & quantity of writing (with further revisions a possibility)

## Suggestion Submission Guidelines
Each suggestion has been:  

1. confirmed as understood by me  
2. confirmed as as original, non-duplicate ideas to the project  

Please feel free to open a new question thread in the [message board](https://github.com/avidrucker/autofocus-exp/issues) if you have any further questions relating to submitting deliverables or compensation.
